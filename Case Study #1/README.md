# SQL Case Study #1. Dannys-Diner
This is Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner of Danny Ma's 8 Week SQL challenge.

I have used MySQL Workbench 8.0 to solve the problems.

#Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially
about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are
their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better
and more personalized experience for his loyal customers. He plans on using these insights to
help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally
he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without
needing to use SQL. Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to
privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning
SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

.sales
.menu
.members
