# SQL Case Study #2. Pizza Runner
This is Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner of Danny Ma's 8 Week SQL challenge.

I have used MySQL Workbench 8.0 to solve the problems.

#Problem Statement

Danny wants to start a pizza empire and uberize it so he launched Pizza Runner.
Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.
